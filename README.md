API Rate Limits

Instagram API has certain rate limits you need to be aware of:

Basic Instagram API Rate Limits:

200 GET requests per hour for user-related data (such as followers, following).


Be cautious with frequent API requests as exceeding the limit can result in temporary suspension of API access. It’s recommended to add delays between API calls or use batch requests to stay within the limit.

If your app frequently exceeds rate limits, you may consider:

Caching API responses locally.

Spreading requests over a longer time frame.

Upgrading your API access if necessary.
